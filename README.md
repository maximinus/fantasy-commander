# Fantasy Commander

Fantasy Commander (working title) is a fantasy tactical battle game.

- Turn based - Players move synchronously and sequentially.
- Hex map - the game area is composed of tiled hexagons.
- Short battles with the focus on action and fast results.
- A 2D game but presented using a 3D game engine
- Comes with an AI computer opponent
- Is scriptable and can auto-generate new maps.


## Overview

The player will play the role of a fantasy army general. The fantasy world will not be particularly full of the usual tropes of the genre - elves, hobbits and dwarves - but will instead consist of "mostly human" armies, similar to *Game Of Thrones* forces.

The battles will generally be quite short - from 10 minutes to 1 hour. I want the player to see the results of their actions quite quickly, and this is not a game of resource collection.

The rules will be based on current *Wargames Research Group* rules for ancients and will therefore have some claim to be historically valid to some small degree, if that can be said of a fantasy game.

The eventual aim is that a series of battles can be put together to make a scenario, similar to those of *Panzer General*.

The game will be both scriptable and configurable, allowing user to make their own battles, scenarios and indeed rules.

## Future Goals

As this is a new project, goals at this stage are fairly modest. Currently, for Alpha 0.1, we are looking at:

- Open up a game window and display a map of hexes
- Allow the user to scroll and zoom the map
- Allow user to highlight one hex
- Runs on Linux, Mac and Windows

## Tech Stack

- Programming Language: Python 3
- 3D Engine: Panda3D
- Scripting language: To be decided
- Config files: JSON or YAML

## Contributing

We are always looking for contributers, even at this early stage. Writers and artists who contribute at this point would likely set the feel and the tone for a lot of the game. Right now, this project relly needs:

- Concept Artists
- Rules Designers
- Musicians
- Writers
- Web designers and programmers
- Python programmers
